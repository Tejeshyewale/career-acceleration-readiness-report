This repository contains a Career Acceleration Readiness Report generated using DT’s Evolution Compass and Delegable Capabilities framework.

The report evaluates leadership maturity and decision-making readiness across five dimensions:
1. Self-Awareness & Self-Esteem  
2. Observation & Input Streams  
3. Self-Actualization & Transcendence  
4. Dialogue & Listening Skills  
5. Identity & Career Acceleration Readiness  

It is designed to help individuals assess their trajectory toward senior leadership and long-horizon roles, including CEO potential, by focusing on judgment, clarity, and ownership rather than titles or credentials.
